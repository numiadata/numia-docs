# NumiaAI: Data Chatbot for Easy Querying

NumiaAI is a prototype AI chatbot that simplifies interacting with blockchain data. Instead of using APIs or writing SQL queries, you can ask natural language questions, and NumiaAI will retrieve and present the data in response. Itâ€™s designed to make data access easier by interpreting your questions and fetching the relevant information automatically.
