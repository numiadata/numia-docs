title: What's NumiaAPI?
---

NumiaAPI offers a robust and seamless way to access rich blockchain endpoints across multiple chains. Onchain data is very hard to parse and difficult to make sense out of. By indexing, aggregating and enriching onchain data we are able to provide an advanced API for developers to they focus on their users and not on indexing.

## Why NumiaAPI?
Traditional RPC REST endpoints typically provide the current state of a chain, but they don't offer historical data or deep analytics. Furthermore, archive nodes are costly to maintain and challenging to query effectively. This is where NumiaAPI comes in, providing an advanced suite of endpoints that offer much more than just real-time data.

## Key Features
NumiaAPI is designed to meet the needs of developers, analysts, and applications by providing rich and flexible data endpoints. Our suite of APIs includes:
