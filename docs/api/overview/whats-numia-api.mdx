title: What's NumiaAPI?
---

NumiaAPI offers a robust and seamless way to access rich blockchain data across multiple chains. With nodes distributed across various locations, Numia ensures impeccable uptime and high availability. By connecting to a single provider, applications can interact with data from all supported chains without the need for multiple integrations.

It consolidates data from all supported chains into a single, unified interface, allowing you to interact with a single provider instead of managing multiple integrations. Whether you're working with the Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Evmos, or any of the other supported chains, NumiaAPI ensures that your application can seamlessly query blockchain data without complex setup.


## Why NumiaAPI?
Traditional RPC REST endpoints typically provide the current state of a chain, but they donâ€™t offer historical data or deep analytics. Furthermore, archive nodes are costly to maintain and challenging to query effectively. This is where NumiaAPI comes in, providing an advanced suite of endpoints that offer much more than just real-time data.

## Key Features

NumiaAPI is designed to meet the needs of developers, analysts, and applications by providing rich and flexible data endpoints. Our suite of APIs includes:
