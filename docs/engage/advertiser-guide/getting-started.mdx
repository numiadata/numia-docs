1. **Initial Consultation**: Reach out to our team to discuss your goals and advertising requirements.
2. **Onboarding Call**: Our team will schedule a call to understand your needs, define the campaign scope, and discuss ad placement options.
3. **Form Submission**: After the call, fill out the advertiser onboarding form to provide necessary information, such as budget, target audience, and campaign preferences.
4. **Ad Asset Collection**: Once onboarded, we’ll work with you to gather the required assets, including banners, ad copy, and links.

## Sending ads 
Currently, NumiaEngage’s process for campaign setup is manual, so you need to send ad assets directly to our team. Here’s how it works:

* **Prepare Ad Assets**: Gather your campaign materials, including banners, ad copy, call-to-action text, and target URLs.
* **Submit to NumiaEngage**: Send these assets to your NumiaEngage contact. Our team will review and configure them according to the agreed-upon placement dimensions and specifications.
* **Confirm Placement Details**: We will confirm the dimensions, placements, and any specific campaign restrictions.
* **Campaign Monitoring**: Once the campaign is live, NumiaEngage will provide regular performance reports covering metrics like impressions, clicks, and conversions.

NumiaEngage prioritizes a customer-success-driven approach to ensure the best results and a smooth setup process. For any additional questions, contact your assigned NumiaEngage representative.
