---

This page provides all the necessary steps and examples to get started with the NumiaEngage Attribution SDK, from installation to advanced usage.

## Installation

Install the SDK using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# npm
npm install @numia/engage-sdk

# yarn
yarn add @numia/engage-sdk

# pnpm
pnpm add @numia/engage-sdk
```

## Setup

To begin using the SDK, you need to create an instance of the analytics class. Obtain your API key from the Numia dashboard:

```typescript
import { createEngage } from "@numia/engage-sdk";

const analytics = createEngage({
  app: "soon-unicorn-app", // Your app name
  apiKey: "MySecretWriteKey", // Replace with your WriteKey
  test: true, // Set to false for production
});
```

- **`app`**: The name of your application.
- **`apiKey`**: Your unique WriteKey obtained from the Numia dashboard.
- **`test`**: Optional. Set to `true` for testing environments and `false` for production.


## Usage

### Basic Tracking Methods

The SDK provides three core methods for tracking:

- **Identify**: Links events to a specific wallet address.
- **Track**: Records user actions with associated metadata.
- **Page**: Tracks page views and attribution parameters.

### Identify

Use `Identify` to associate a wallet with the events you are tracking. Numia also assigns an `anonymousId` for visitors who haven't connected a wallet, allowing you to track actions seamlessly.

#### Example:
```typescript
analytics.identify("wallet1234567890", {
  wallet: "Metamask", // Optional metadata
});
```

### Track

The `Track` method records specific user actions, enabling detailed attribution of events to campaigns.

#### Example:
```typescript
analytics.track("Swap Completed", {
  market: "ETH-USDT",
  amount: 50,
  currency: "USDT",
});
```

### Page

The `Page` method captures page views and attribution data, such as UTM parameters, ensuring you don't miss interactions from anonymous users.

#### Example:
```typescript
analytics.page({
  title: "Homepage",
  utm_source: "campaignX",
});
```
