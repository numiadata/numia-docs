## Wallet-Based Targeting
Wallet-based targeting leverages blockchain wallet data to create highly relevant, privacy-compliant ad campaigns. By analyzing users' on-chain activity, NumiaEngage enables advertisers to reach audiences with demonstrated interests in specific crypto products and services. This targeting approach ensures ads are shown to users who are more likely to engage, enhancing ad performance and ROI.


## Publisher Types
NumiaEngage supports untargeted and targeted publishers:
* **Untargeted Publishers**: Display general ads with broader appeal, benefiting from increased traffic volume without specific audience segmentation.
* **Targeted Publishers**: Integrate wallet-based targeting to show ads that align with users' blockchain interests, resulting in a more personalized experience and higher engagement rates.


## Campaign
A campaign is the top-level entity in NumiaEngage, representing a specific advertising effort agreed upon between Numia and the advertiser. Each campaign is run individually and is aimed at achieving particular marketing goals.


## Ads Placement
An ad placement is a designated area on the publisher's platform that is made available for Numia and its advertisers to display targeted ads. This is the space where ads are shown to users.


## Creative
The creative is the complete set of assets, including text and images, needed to fill an ad placement. It contains all the elements required for a cohesive and effective ad display.


## Position ID
The `position_id` is a unique identifier used in requests to specify which ad placement Numia should fill. Each ad placement on the publisher’s platform is assigned a distinct `position_id` provided by Numia.


## CTA (Call-to-Action)
The CTA is the text displayed on the ad’s button, prompting users to take a specific action, such as “Learn More” or “Sign Up.”


## URL
This is the link behind the ad's CTA button. When users click the button, they are redirected to this URL, which typically leads to the advertiser’s landing page.


## Banner URL
Some creatives may include an image banner, accessible through the `banner_url`, which adds visual appeal to the ad placement.


## Client
The client refers to the publisher’s frontend application where ad placements are integrated and displayed to users.
