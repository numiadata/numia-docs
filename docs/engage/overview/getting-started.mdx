## Advertisers
**Advertisers** are companies, blockchain projects, and financial services that aim to reach crypto-engaged audiences. They might include DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, crypto exchanges, and blockchain-based applications. Advertisers leverage NumiaEngage’s wallet-based targeting capabilities to reach users who are active within the crypto space, thus increasing the relevance and effectiveness of their campaigns.


### Typical scenarios 
* **Launching Targeted User Acquisition Campaigns**: Advertisers use NumiaEngage to acquire new users by targeting ads to individuals with blockchain activities that align with their services. This precise targeting enables advertisers to reach users who are more likely to engage with their products.
* **Boosting User Retention and Loyalty**: Advertisers aiming to retain users can run reward or incentive-based campaigns, targeting existing customers who may be at risk of disengagement. 
* **Driving Conversions through Wallet-Driven Insights**: NumiaEngage enables advertisers to deliver highly targeted ads that are tailored to the onchain behaviors of specific user segments. This precision allows advertisers to boost conversion rates by delivering relevant offers to audiences who have demonstrated interest in similar products or services.


### Goals
* **Achieve Higher Conversion Rates**: Leverage wallet-driven targeting to reach crypto-engaged users who are likely to be interested in their offerings, increasing click-through and conversion rates.
* **Maximize Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**: By precisely targeting users with relevant ads, advertisers reduce ad spend waste and ensure that their campaigns yield high returns.
