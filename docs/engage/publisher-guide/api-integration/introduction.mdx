Once onboarded, you can start using the Publisher API to request targeted ads and track engagement metrics. It's built around RESTful principles and utilizes standard HTTP protocols, returning JSON payloads in response to HTTP requests. You can perform operations using the GET and POST methods.

1. **API Access**: Contact the NumiaEngage team to set up access credentials and obtain API keys.
2. [**Environments**](/engage/publisher-guide/api-integration/environments): Check the details of each available environments. 
3. **Ad Placements**: Work with the Numia team to determine the ideal placements for your ads, including assigning specific `position_id`'s to each location.
4. [**API Guides**](/engage/publisher-guide/api-integration/guides/get-campaign): Understand how to request ads and track events.
5. **Test Endpoints**: Familiarize yourself with the available endpoints in the API Playground and configure initial requests.
