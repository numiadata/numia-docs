This page provides an overview of NumiaEngage’s onboarding and integration process. 

1. **Initial Consultation**: Connect with our team to discuss your platform’s needs and how NumiaEngage can be customized to meet them.
2. **Integration Planning**: Our technical team will work with you to create a tailored integration plan that aligns with your site’s structure and goals.
3. **Integrate NumiaEngage API**: To display targeted ads to your users, integrate with NumiaEngage’s ad engine by making API calls to retrieve ads based on each user’s blockchain activity. You can also integrate calls to track user interactions to maximize ad relevance. Read more about the integration process on **API Integration for Targeted Ads (Page).**
4. **Configure Targeting Preferences**: Work with our team to set up your targeting preferences and customize your ad placements to best suit your audience.
5. **Test and Optimize**: After implementation, conduct testing with our support team to ensure everything functions correctly. This includes checking ad placements, tracking metrics, and optimizing for user engagement.
6. **Add Analytics Events**:You can also tag analytics events within your client or backend that make a callback to our engine. These events will help us provide better data to the publisher. Some examples are “connect_wallet” after a user clicks on a non-targeted ad, or “notification_open” if your ad is a notification-based one.
