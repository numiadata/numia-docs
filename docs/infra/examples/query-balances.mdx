title: Query Balances
---

Retrieve the balances of a specific wallet address using REST endpoints. This is useful for applications that need to display the current token holdings of a user or track balance changes over time.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://<chain>-lcd.numia.xyz/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/balances/<address>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>"
```

**Parameters:**
- **`<chain>`**: Replace with the chain youâ€™re querying (e.g., `osmosis-lcd`).
- **`<address>`**: The wallet address whose balances you want to fetch.
- **`<your_api_key>`**: Your API key for authentication.

The response includes a list of tokens held by the specified address, with details such as token denominations and amounts.
