The Snapshot Tool in **Lenses** allows users to schedule and generate CSV-based snapshots of blockchain data. This tool is ideal for creating recurring or one-time reports on data like token balances, liquidity information, or transaction details. Below is a detailed example and guide to using the Snapshot Tool.

## Example Use Case: Scheduling a Snapshot for Liquidity Providers of ATOM on Osmosis

The Snapshot Tool can generate a CSV file that includes details about liquidity providers holding ATOM on the Osmosis network. These snapshots are useful for tracking user participation, calculating rewards, or analyzing token distribution.

### **Steps to Schedule and Retrieve a Snapshot**
1. **Access the Snapshot Tool**: Navigate to the Snapshot Tool section in the Lenses dashboard.
2. **New Campaign**: Click the "New Campaign" button to define the snapshot parameters.

3. **Specify Time Settings**: Decide whether the snapshot should be a one-time export or scheduled at regular intervals.
    - **One-Time**: Choose the specific snapshot date.
    - **Recurring**: Define start and end dates, snapshot interval, and the total of snapshots to be taken.

4. **Define Snapshot Settings**:
    - **Chain**: Select the _Osmosis_ ecosystem.
    - **Token Type**: Choose the relevant dataset. In this example, select _Osmosis-Pools_.
    - **Token**: In this example, select _ATOM_.

5. **Generate and Download CSV**:
  - Once the snapshot is configured, initiate the generation process.
  - After completion, download the CSV file directly from the dashboard.

### **Example Output**
The CSV file includes the following columns:
- **Address**: The blockchain address of the liquidity provider.
- **Token Balance**: The amount of ATOM held by the provider.
- **Block Timestamp**: The exact timestamp when the snapshot was taken.

#### Sample CSV Output Data:
| Address                                  | Token Balance | Block Timestamp     |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| osmo1x1234abcd5678efgh91011ijklmnopqrst  | 1,250.75      | 2025-01-01T12:00:00Z|
| osmo1z7890abcd1234efgh56789ijklmnopqrst  | 950.50        | 2025-01-01T12:00:00Z|

## Best Practices
- **Recurring Snapshots**: Use scheduled snapshots for regular reports, such as weekly reward calculations or monthly participation tracking.
- **Data Validation**: Verify the snapshot parameters to ensure accurate and relevant data.
- **Integration**: Combine the exported CSV data with your preferred analytics tools (e.g., Excel, Tableau) for deeper insights.
