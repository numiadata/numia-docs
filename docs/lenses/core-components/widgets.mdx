Lenses offers a range of widgets that allow users to visualize and interact with blockchain data in a meaningful way. These widgets are designed to cater to different data analysis needs, from high-level metrics to customizable charts.

## KPI Widgets
KPI (Key Performance Indicator) Widgets provide static, at-a-glance metrics that highlight the most important values related to blockchain activity. These widgets are particularly useful for:

- Displaying metrics like all time trading volume, monthly active users, and more.
- Providing immediate insights without requiring user interaction.

## Interactive Widgets
Interactive Widgets allow users to explore data more dynamically, offering the ability to customize views and drill down into specific datasets. Filters and toggles can be used to refine timeframes, select specific data series, adjust accumulation settings, and more, providing you with a more tailored analysis. 

In the video example below, the Market Volume Overview widget is configured to show only BTC/USD, hourly, for the last 14 days as a bar chart.

Now, you can also change the timeframe being shown, as exemplified below:
