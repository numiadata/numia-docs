Refer to the [Available Chains](docs/sql/querying-data/chains/available-chains) section for detailed schema information and insights into the processed tables specific to each blockchain. In addition, you can view the partitioning and clustering details for each processed table in the table's metadata section. Leverage these details to write more efficient queries.
