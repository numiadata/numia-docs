## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud account

To begin, create a Google Cloud account if you don’t already have one. The process is simple and similar to signing up for a Gmail account. Once your account is set up and you're logged in:

1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console.
2. On the left-hand menu, explore the various products available. Under the **Analytics** section, locate **BigQuery**.

## Step 2: Access BigQuery

Once inside BigQuery, you’ll see the dashboard where you’ll run your queries. To access Numia’s datasets:

1. Click on **Add Data** in the left-hand menu.
2. Select **Start a project by name** and enter `Numia data`.
3. After adding the project, you’ll see **Numia data** pinned in the left-hand panel.

## Step 3: Explore the available datasets

After pinning the Numia datasets, open the **Numia data** section to view the available datasets, such as:
  - **Osmosis**: Includes corresponding tables and data for the Osmosis blockchain.
  - **Evmos**: Contains relevant tables for the Evmos ecosystem.
  - **Cosmos Hub**: Features detailed views and tables for Cosmos Hub.
  - **Token Prices**: Provides expanding data on token price trends.

## Step 4: Explore dataset details

To understand the structure of each dataset:

1. Click on any dataset to expand it.
2. Review the tables and schemas to see available columns, data types, and sizes.
3. Use this information to plan and write your queries.


## Next steps

Now that you’ve set up access to Numia Data, you can:

1. Start running queries against the pinned datasets using [How to Query Numia Datasets](/sql/how-to-query-numia-datasets) as a reference.
2. Explore Query Optimization [How to Query Numia Datasets](/sql/how-to-query-numia-datasets/optimize-queries) for query optimization tips and data examples.
3. Check tables and schemas for the chains.
