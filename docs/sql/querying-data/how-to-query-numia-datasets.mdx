title: How to Query Numia Datasets
---


This guide will help you get started with accessing and querying Numia’s production datasets on Google BigQuery.

## Step 1: Pin `numia-data` to your datasets

BigQuery organizes data into projects, which act as containers for datasets. Numia currently provides two projects:

- **`immaculate-355716` (Beta)**: Temporary and will be deprecated in the coming months.  
- **`numia-data` (Production)**: The official production project for long-term use.


### Instructions:
1. Open the BigQuery Console in Google Cloud.
2. Click **ADD DATA** > **Star a project by name**.
3. Enter `numia-data` to pin our production dataset.

Avoid using `immaculate-355716` as it will be deprecated soon.

## Step 2: Query `numia-data`

Once the `numia-data` project is pinned, you can start exploring and querying the datasets. To query a table, use the following structure in your SQL `FROM` clause:

```sql
`project`.`dataset`.`table`
```

For example, to query the `osmosis_blocks` table in the `osmosis` dataset, use the following:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM `numia-data.osmosis.osmosis_blocks`
```

- **`numia-data`**: The project containing Numia’s datasets.
- **`osmosis`**: The dataset for the Osmosis blockchain.
- **`osmosis_blocks`**: The specific table being queried.
