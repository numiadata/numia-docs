This page presents two practical examples of how to query Numiaâ€™s datasets for insights. These examples demonstrate analyzing trades on the Osmosis DEX and querying staking balances on Celestia.


## Trades on Osmosis DEX by pool

This query counts all token swaps on the Osmosis DEX and groups the trades by `Pool_ID`, ordering the results by the number of trades in descending order. It helps identify the most active liquidity pools on the Osmosis DEX.


```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS Trades,
  attribute_value AS Pool_ID
FROM `numia-data.osmosis.osmosis_event_attributes`
WHERE event_type = 'token_swapped'  
  AND attribute_key = 'pool_id'
GROUP BY Pool_ID
ORDER BY Trades DESC;
```

### Breakdown:
- **`COUNT(*)`**: Counts the total number of token swaps (trades).  
- **`attribute_value AS Pool_ID`**: Identifies the pool associated with each trade.  
- **`GROUP BY`**: Groups results by `Pool_ID`.  
- **`ORDER BY Trades DESC`**: Orders the pools by the number of trades, from highest to lowest.  


## Staking calance of a Celestia user

This query calculates the total staking balance for a specific user (`sender`) at a particular block height by combining their delegations and undelegations.

```sql
SELECT sender, SUM(token_amount) AS token_amount
FROM (
  SELECT sender, token_amount 
  FROM `numia-data.celestia.celestia_delegate`
  WHERE sender = 'celestia1r0gmufmz9em8anlxd8exygwwllhk3ny6g4hqlz'
    AND block_height <= 1654914

  UNION ALL

  SELECT sender, -token_amount
  FROM `numia-data.celestia.celestia_undelegate`
  WHERE sender = 'celestia1r0gmufmz9em8anlxd8exygwwllhk3ny6g4hqlz'
    AND block_height <= 1654914
)
GROUP BY sender
ORDER BY token_amount DESC;
```

### Breakdown:
- **Delegations and Undelegations**:  
  - Delegated amounts are pulled from `celestia_delegate`.  
  - Undelegated amounts are pulled from `celestia_undelegate` as negative values using `-token_amount`.  
- **`UNION ALL`**: Combines both delegated and undelegated amounts for the same user.  
- **`SUM(token_amount)`**: Calculates the net staking balance.  
- **`block_height <= 1654914`**: Ensures the calculation reflects the state at the specified block height.  
- **`GROUP BY sender`**: Groups results by the user.  
- **`ORDER BY token_amount DESC`**: Orders users by staking balance.


## Most common user paths
This query returns the most common paths by message type, helping you understand what users do after claiming rewards, delegating tokens, or performing other specific actions.

```sql
WITH transactions AS (
  SELECT
    tx_id,
    msg_index,
    block_timestamp,
    message_type AS action,
    sender AS sender,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY sender ORDER BY block_timestamp ASC, tx_id ASC, msg_index ASC) AS sequence
  FROM `numia-data.evmos.evmos_message_types_transactions`
  WHERE block_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
  ORDER BY sender ASC, sequence ASC, msg_index ASC
)
SELECT 
  t1.tx_id,
  t1.sender,
  t1.action AS action_1,
  t2.action AS action_2,
  t3.action AS action_3
FROM transactions t1
INNER JOIN transactions t2 ON t1.sender = t2.sender AND t2.sequence = t1.sequence + 1 AND t1.action <> t2.action
INNER JOIN transactions t3 ON t1.sender = t3.sender AND t3.sequence = t1.sequence + 2 AND t1.action <> t2.action
ORDER BY sender, t1.sequence ASC;

SELECT 
  action_1 || ' -> ' || action_2 || ' -> ' || action_3 AS path,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM transactions
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

## Monthly Retention
This query calculates monthly retention by identifying user cohorts and tracking their activity over time.

```sql
WITH active_users AS (
  SELECT 
    attribute_value AS user,
    DATE(b.block_timestamp) AS activity_date
  FROM `numia-data.evmos.evmos_event_attributes` ea
  INNER JOIN `numia-data.evmos.evmos_blocks` b ON CAST(b.block_height AS INT64) = ea.block_height
  WHERE attribute_key = 'sender'
    AND attribute_value LIKE 'evmos%'
),
user_cohorts AS (
  SELECT 
    user AS user,
    MIN(DATE_TRUNC(DATE(activity_date), MONTH)) AS cohortMonth
  FROM active_users
  GROUP BY 1
),
order_month AS (
  SELECT 
    uc.user AS user,
    DATE_DIFF(DATE_TRUNC(DATE(activity_date), MONTH), cohortMonth, MONTH) AS month_number,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(uc.user)) AS users
  FROM active_users au
  LEFT JOIN user_cohorts uc ON uc.user = au.user
  GROUP BY 1, 2
),
cohort_size AS (
  SELECT  
    COUNT(DISTINCT(user)) AS users, 
    cohortMonth
  FROM user_cohorts uc
  GROUP BY 2
  ORDER BY 1
),
retention_table AS (
  SELECT  
    c.cohortMonth, 
    o.month_number, 
    SUM(users) AS users
  FROM order_month o
  LEFT JOIN user_cohorts c ON c.user = o.user
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT  
  r.cohortMonth, 
  s.users AS totalUsers,
  r.month_number, 
  r.users / s.users AS percentage
FROM retention_table r
LEFT JOIN cohort_size s ON s.cohortMonth = r.cohortMonth
WHERE r.cohortMonth IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1, 3;
```

## Active users
This query calculates the daily count of active users by action type.

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(block_timestamp) AS day,
  message_type AS action,
  COUNT(DISTINCT(sender)) AS active_users
FROM 
  `numia-data.evmos.evmos_message_types_transactions`
GROUP BY 
  day, action
ORDER BY 
  day, action;
```

## Delegations over time by validator
This query tracks token delegations over time, grouped by validator.

```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(block_timestamp) AS day,
  validator,
  SUM(osmo_amount) AS delegated_amount,
  COUNT(*) AS n_delegations
FROM 
  `numia-data.evmos.evmos_delegate`
GROUP BY
  day, validator
ORDER BY
  day, validator;
```
